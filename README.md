# Comp562-Final-Project

## Overview
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally, accounting for 32% of all deaths according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Early detection and targeted intervention can significantly reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict heart disease based on clinical parameters, aiming to determine the most accurate model and identify the most significant predictive features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset sourced from Kaggle. It contains 918 observations, as well as 12 clinical and demographic variables:
* Features: Age, Sex, ChestPainType, RestingBP, Cholesterol, FastingBS, RestingECG, MaxHR, ExerciseAngina, Oldpeak, ST_Slope
* Target variable: HeartDisease
  
## Objectives
* Predict heart disease: Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease.
* Feature importance: Identify which clinical and demographic features most significantly contribute to heart disease predictions.
* Model comparison: Compare logistic regression and random forest models to determine the most effective predictor.

## Libraries Used
* scikit-learn
* numpy
* pandas
* scipy
